                    <p>We are an energetic folk quintet, performing with energy, improvisation and love.</p>
                    <p>We met met when working on Deafintely Theatre's 2014 production of A Midummer Nights Dream, performed at Shakespeareâ€™s Globe. We accompanied the action (performed in British Sign Language) with a full non-stop live score, to wide acclaim. </p>
                    <p>After a solid month of rehearsing, improvising, laughing, crying (from laughter), creating and collaborating we became very close, and emerged from theatre with a set of beautiful songs, energetic jigs, flamenco flourishes, foot-tapping swing numbers and raucous tango jams. More than that we had discovered a strong musical bond, and passion for playing together which seemed a shame to waste! And so, inspired by the show, Puck was born.</p>
